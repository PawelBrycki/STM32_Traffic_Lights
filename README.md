# 🚦 Simple Traffic Light Simulation using STM32 Nucleo

his project is a basic simulation of traffic lights using an STM32 Nucleo board and external LEDs. It demonstrates how to use GPIO pins configured as outputs to control LEDs, and serves as an introductory exercise in embedded programming with STM32.

The project helped me understand:

-> How to configure GPIO pins in output mode using STM32CubeMX and HAL
-> How to toggle LEDs based on simple logic
-> The basic project structure for STM32 applications

🛠️ Platform: STM32 Nucleo-G071RB
💡 Tools used: STM32CubeMX, STM32CubeIDE, HAL drivers

This project was created as part of my STM32 programming practice.
